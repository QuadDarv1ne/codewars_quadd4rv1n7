[ Function 1 - hello world ]

Make a simple function called greet that returns the most-famous "hello world".

Style Points:
Sure, this is about as easy as it gets.
But how clever can you be to create the most creative "hello world" you can think of ?
What is a "hello world" solution you would want to show your friends ?
